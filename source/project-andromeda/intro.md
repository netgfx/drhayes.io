I've recently become interested in doing some hardware hacking and I've been
looking for a more meaningful project than "make those LEDs blink". This is part
of my in-built engineer drive to make everything more complicated. I'd argue,
though, that it makes the projects more *significant*, as well. I'm more likely
to work on something that's meaningful to me. So I started casting around for
meaningful projects that I could take my time on that would teach me a lot.

Then it hit me: my son loves to drive our car.

I always sit in there with him and turn on the engine so it's easier
for him to turn the wheel and see dashboard lights when he pushes buttons. He's
reaching an age where he appreciates how much of an effect he can have on the
world and I love enabling that whenever I can. It's fun to watch his face as
the wipers swish, the emergency flashers go off, and **oh God don't let him
shift into reverse--**. Anyhoo.

However, I don't like that it uses gas and, y'know, for heaven's sake, he's
sitting in our car with the engine running pushing random buttons. That's not
so great.

Enter...

*Project Andromeda* is my codename for the spaceship console I'm going to build
for my son. [Here's the GitHub repo][repo].
